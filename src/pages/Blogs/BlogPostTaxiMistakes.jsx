                <p>
                    Starting or running a taxi company can be rewarding ‚Äî but many new and independent operators fall into avoidable traps that limit growth, reduce profitability, or lead to early closure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At <strong>Nearby</strong>, we‚Äôve supported hundreds of taxi businesses across the UK. Here are the top mistakes we‚Äôve seen ‚Äî and what you can do differently.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">1. Underestimating the Importance of Branding</h2>
                <p>
                    Many new taxi firms launch without a professional brand. A basic logo, no uniformity in vehicles, and a weak online presence all hurt credibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fix:</strong> Invest early in quality branding. Consistent visuals, branded vehicle livery, and a professional website/app build trust and attract bookings.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">2. Relying Solely on Phone Bookings</h2>
                <p>
                    Some independents still rely heavily on phone calls, ignoring apps and online portals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fix:</strong> Customers expect digital options. Offer online booking, passenger apps, and integrations with hotel/airport systems. This widens your reach and saves time.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">3. Using Outdated or Disconnected Software</h2>
                <p>
                    Running dispatch on spreadsheets or legacy systems leads to delays, inefficiency, and frustrated drivers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fix:</strong> Adopt modern dispatch software and driver apps that streamline bookings, payments, and tracking. A franchise like Nearby gives you this from day one.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">4. Paying Too Much for Insurance, Tech & Payments</h2>
                <p>
                    Buying everything individually ‚Äî from card readers to insurance ‚Äî is expensive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fix:</strong> Join a network or group scheme that negotiates lower costs on your behalf. Franchising helps reduce your operational overhead.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">5. Failing to Train or Motivate Drivers</h2>
                <p>
                    Your drivers are the face of your brand. Poor service, late arrivals, or untrained staff will damage your reputation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fix:</strong> Set service standards. Provide onboarding training, regular feedback, and reward programs for top-performing drivers.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">6. Not Tracking Key Business Metrics</h2>
                <p>
                    Many new businesses don‚Äôt monitor KPIs like revenue per driver, repeat customer rate, or average trip distance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fix:</strong> Use data dashboards and reports to guide decisions. Small improvements (like reducing dead mileage) make a big difference.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">7. Trying to Do Everything Alone</h2>
                <p>
                    Running operations, marketing, finances, recruitment ‚Äî it‚Äôs too much for one person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fix:</strong> Outsource where possible. Join a franchise to get central support, automated systems, and experienced advice.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">Final Thought: Don‚Äôt Reinvent the Wheel</h2>
                <p>
                    Most taxi business mistakes come from a lack of experience or structure. You don‚Äôt need to figure everything out alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By joining a franchise like <strong>Nearby</strong>, you gain systems, branding, software, and support designed to help you avoid the common pitfalls ‚Äî and scale faster.
