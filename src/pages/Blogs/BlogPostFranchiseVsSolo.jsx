                    Launching a taxi or private hire business is an exciting opportunity ‚Äî but deciding whether to go independent or join a franchise can make all the difference between struggling and scaling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Nearby, we‚Äôve seen firsthand how franchising gives new operators the structure, support, and systems they need to thrive in today‚Äôs competitive transport landscape.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">1. Proven Business Model</h2>
                <p>
                    When you join a franchise like Nearby, you're not starting from scratch. You‚Äôre tapping into a fully developed system that has already worked for others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From day one, you benefit from strategies, branding, and operational know-how that‚Äôs been tested and refined over time.
                    Going solo often means trial and error ‚Äî which costs time, money, and missed opportunities.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">2. Brand Recognition & Marketing Power</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest hurdles for new transport businesses is building trust. Customers want to ride with companies they recognize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a franchisee, you gain instant credibility under the Nearby name ‚Äî along with access to:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                    <li>Professionally designed logos and vehicle livery</li>
                    <li>Website and app branding</li>
                    <li>Local marketing materials</li>
                    <li>Social media support</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Solo operators often spend months (and thousands of pounds) creating this from scratch.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">3. Technology & Tools Ready to Go</h2>
                <p>
                    With Nearby, you get immediate access to:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                    <li>A full-featured dispatch system</li>
                    <li>Driver and customer apps</li>
                    <li>Booking web portal</li>
                    <li>Call centre support</li>
                    <li>Payment systems and driver wallets</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This saves months of tech development and avoids the hassle of trying to connect multiple platforms.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">4. Financial Benefits & Cost Savings</h2>
                <p>
                    Franchisees benefit from:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                    <li>Pre-negotiated merchant account rates</li>
                    <li>Shared call centre costs</li>
                    <li>Discounted dispatch software</li>
                    <li>Better broadband and SIP packages</li>
                    <li>POS machine rentals</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Going alone? Expect to pay full retail prices ‚Äî and deal with complex contracts and setup.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">5. Support When You Need It</h2>
                <p>
                    Every franchisee has access to Nearby‚Äôs onboarding team, launch support, training sessions, and ongoing business advice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of facing everything alone ‚Äî from licensing to growth challenges ‚Äî you have a partner to lean on.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#94C120]">Conclusion: Franchising Offers Speed, Stability & Scale</h2>
                <p>
                    If you're serious about building a lasting taxi business, franchising gives you a smarter foundation.
                    You skip the startup chaos. You leverage expert support. And most importantly, you focus on growth, not survival.
